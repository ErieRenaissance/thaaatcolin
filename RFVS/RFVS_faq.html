                        <p>Typically, yes, but the level and duration are flexible based on your preferences. Most legacy owners remain involved through a consulting agreement for 6-18 months to ensure smooth knowledge transfer. This arrangement:</p>

                            <li>Provides continuity for employees and customers</li>

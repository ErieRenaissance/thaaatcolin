    const descriptions = {
    root: "Manufacturing investment represents the foundational commitment of substantial capital to physical production facilities, specialized equipment, land acquisition, and infrastructure that anchor long-term economic development. Unlike knowledge-based businesses that can rapidly relocate, manufacturing facilities require multi-million dollar investments in fixed assets that create decades-long commitments to specific geographic locations, generating predictable tax revenues and stable employment that ripple through entire regional economies.",
    tax_revenue: "Long-term manufacturing investments create predictable, stable tax revenue streams for local governments spanning decades, which reduce municipal borrowing costs through improved credit ratings and lower debt service expenses. These predictable revenues allow local governments to make long-term capital commitments for infrastructure projects including roads, water systems, and public transportation, while enabling sustained investment in public education systems, competitive teacher salaries, modern educational facilities, and quality community amenities including parks, libraries, recreation centers, and cultural facilities that would be impossible to fund with volatile tax bases.",
    jobs: "Stable manufacturing employment provides middle-class incomes ranging from $50,000 to $80,000 annually with consistent schedules, comprehensive benefits including health insurance and retirement plans, and predictable career progression that creates household financial security across multiple generations. Unlike gig economy or service sector jobs with variable hours and minimal benefits, manufacturing positions offer the economic stability that enables families to purchase homes, save for retirement, invest in children's education, and build generational wealth through decades of steady employment in the same community.",
    supply: "Manufacturing presence catalyzes the organic development of supplier ecosystems as complementary businesses establish operations nearby to serve manufacturing needs, creating dense networks of suppliers providing raw materials, components, tooling, maintenance services, specialized logistics, and technical support. These supplier networks reduce transportation costs, minimize lead times, enable just-in-time inventory management, and create knowledge spillovers through proximity that increase the competitiveness of all manufacturers in the region compared to those operating in isolation.",
    infrastructure: "Infrastructure investment in roads, bridges, water and sewer systems, reliable electrical grids, high-speed broadband internet, and public transportation creates the physical and digital foundation that enables diverse economic activity far beyond manufacturing alone. Modern, well-maintained infrastructure reduces business operating costs across all sectors, attracts knowledge workers who demand quality of life amenities, supports technology sector development through digital connectivity, and signals to potential investors that the region is serious about long-term economic development rather than allowing critical systems to deteriorate.",
    education: "Sustained education funding enabled by stable tax revenues supports comprehensive programming including STEM curricula, arts education, vocational training, and advanced placement courses while attracting and retaining experienced, highly-qualified teachers through competitive compensation packages. Well-funded schools maintain modern facilities with updated technology, adequate materials and supplies, and student support services that produce locally-trained workforce with skills precisely aligned to regional industry needs, reducing employer recruitment costs and creating talent pipelines that keep young people in their home communities rather than forcing them to relocate for opportunity.",
    amenities: "Community amenities including well-maintained parks and green spaces, public libraries with modern collections and programming, recreation centers offering youth and adult activities, community centers hosting civic events, and cultural facilities such as theaters and museums attract both residents and businesses while dramatically enhancing overall livability and quality of life. These amenities signal that a community invests in its residents' wellbeing rather than treating them merely as economic inputs, creating the kind of distinctive community character that makes regions competitive in attracting and retaining talented workers who have geographic mobility and can choose where to live based on quality of life factors.",
    income: "Income stability from reliable manufacturing employment dramatically reduces household financial stress and anxiety about meeting basic needs for food, shelter, and healthcare, enabling families to engage in regular savings, invest in 401(k) retirement accounts, build emergency funds, and pursue long-term financial planning that builds generational wealth. This stability allows families to make major purchases like homes and vehicles with confidence, invest in children's education and enrichment activities, and weather temporary setbacks without falling into poverty, creating upward economic mobility that is increasingly rare in economies dominated by precarious gig work and variable-hour service employment.",
    suppliers: "Dense supplier networks created by geographic clustering of complementary manufacturers reduce logistics costs through shortened transportation distances, minimize lead times from days or weeks down to hours, enable just-in-time inventory practices that reduce working capital requirements, and create agglomeration economies where proximity generates informal knowledge exchange, collaborative problem-solving, and rapid diffusion of innovations. This geographic concentration of specialized suppliers creates regional competitive advantages that are difficult for other regions to replicate, as the network effects of clustered suppliers make it increasingly attractive for additional manufacturers to locate in the same region.",
    tech: "Modern digital infrastructure including fiber optic broadband, reliable high-speed internet access, extensive wireless coverage, and advanced telecommunications networks particularly supports technology sector development by enabling distributed work models, cloud computing, remote collaboration, and data-intensive applications. This infrastructure attracts software companies, digital services firms, remote workers for national technology companies, and innovation-focused startups that require robust connectivity but can locate anywhere with adequate digital infrastructure, diversifying the economic base beyond traditional manufacturing while leveraging existing physical infrastructure investments.",
    talent: "High-quality infrastructure combined with attractive community amenities creates a powerful combination that attracts knowledge workers, creative professionals, engineers, designers, and educated talent who are seeking livable communities with good schools, cultural opportunities, outdoor recreation, and modern urban amenities rather than simply chasing the highest salaries in expensive coastal markets. As talented workers increasingly prioritize quality of life and housing affordability over marginal salary differences, regions with strong infrastructure and amenities can compete for talent that was previously concentrated in expensive metropolitan areas experiencing quality of life crises.",
    workforce: "Quality education systems produce locally-trained workforce with technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and work readiness precisely aligned to regional industry needs, dramatically reducing employer recruitment costs, shortening time-to-productivity for new hires, and minimizing the brain drain of young talent leaving for opportunities elsewhere. When local youth can see clear pathways from education to good careers in their home communities, they are significantly more likely to remain after graduation rather than relocating to distant cities, preserving family networks and ensuring that the community benefits from its investment in education rather than subsidizing workforce development for other regions.",
    housing: "Stable housing markets created by consistent demand from families with reliable incomes preserve and grow household wealth through home equity appreciation, prevent displacement and gentrification that disrupts community cohesion, and enable long-term community investment as families put down roots rather than viewing their residence as temporary. Housing stability allows families to invest in property improvements, participate in neighborhood associations, build relationships with neighbors, and develop deep community ties that strengthen social capital, while preventing the devastating boom-bust cycles that destroy household wealth and destabilize entire regions.",
    health: "Reduced financial stress from income stability dramatically improves both physical and mental health outcomes by reducing chronic stress hormones like cortisol, enabling better sleep quality, supporting healthier eating habits, reducing substance abuse and self-medication, and allowing people to address health concerns before they become crises. These improved health outcomes lower healthcare costs for both families and employers through reduced emergency room visits, fewer chronic disease complications, better medication adherence, and more preventive care, while improving workplace productivity through reduced absenteeism and presenteeism.",
    logistics: "Strategic logistics infrastructure including rail connections, highway access, proximity to airports or seaports, and modern warehousing facilities positions regions as natural distribution centers for serving multi-state market areas, attracting third-party logistics companies, fulfillment centers, regional distribution hubs, and freight consolidation operations. This logistics infrastructure creates permanent competitive advantages based on geography and transportation networks that cannot be easily replicated, as companies seeking to minimize transportation costs and delivery times must locate distribution operations in regions with superior logistics connectivity regardless of other factors.",
    qol: "Comprehensive quality of life improvements emerging from infrastructure investment, educational excellence, and community amenities make communities highly attractive destinations for families and businesses who are evaluating multiple location options based on factors beyond simple cost considerations. Quality of life encompasses school quality, crime rates, environmental quality, healthcare access, cultural amenities, recreation opportunities, social capital, civic engagement, and overall livability—factors that increasingly drive location decisions for both skilled workers and the companies competing to employ them, as marginal differences in business costs become less important than access to talent and quality of life.",
    brain_drain: "Local opportunities for well-paying careers with clear advancement pathways encourage locally-trained workers to remain in their home communities rather than relocating to distant cities for opportunities that don't exist locally, preserving extended family networks across generations and ensuring that communities benefit from their investments in education and workforce development. Preventing brain drain keeps young professionals engaged in local civic life, maintains community institutional knowledge, preserves multi-generational family structures, and prevents the downward spiral where talent exodus makes communities less attractive, causing even more talent to leave in a self-reinforcing cycle of decline.",
    culture: "Cultural venues including professional theaters, art galleries, music venues, independent bookstores, distinctive local restaurants, craft breweries, and arts festivals create vibrancy and distinctive community character that attracts creative professionals, tourists, and young professionals who seek communities with cultural depth rather than generic suburban sprawl. These cultural amenities signal sophistication and quality of life that differentiates communities from competitors, creates buzz and media attention, supports creative industries and entrepreneurship, and generates the kind of authentic sense of place that cannot be manufactured but emerges organically from sustained investment in arts and culture.",
    equity: "Housing appreciation through stable market dynamics builds substantial wealth for middle-class families as their largest asset grows in value over time, providing collateral for home equity loans or cash-out refinancing that enables parents to finance children's college education without excessive student debt, provides capital for starting small businesses without relying on external investors, and creates financial security for retirement through both equity and reverse mortgages. This home equity represents the primary mechanism of wealth building for middle-class families and is dramatically more important than stock market investments or retirement accounts for most households' long-term financial security.",
    healthcare: "Growing population with employer-provided health insurance creates financially viable market conditions that attract physicians, specialists, and advanced medical facilities to establish practices in the region, enabling residents to access quality healthcare locally rather than traveling to distant medical centers. This healthcare infrastructure enables aging residents to remain in their communities rather than relocating for medical services, attracts medical professionals who become civically engaged community members, supports medical research and innovation, and creates stable, well-paying healthcare employment that cannot be automated or outsourced and further diversifies the economic base.",
    population: "Improved quality of life resulting from infrastructure investment, educational excellence, amenities, and economic opportunity attracts new residents from other regions and grows regional population organically through higher birth rates and lower out-migration, deepening labor markets with more diverse skill sets and expanding consumer bases to support more retail and service businesses. Population growth creates momentum and optimism that attract further investment, support infrastructure expansion, enable new business formation, and reverse the downward spiral of population decline that plagues many post-industrial communities.",
    family: "Multi-generational family proximity created when young adults can build careers in their home communities provides informal childcare through grandparents that can save families $1,000-$2,000 per month per child, transfers tacit community knowledge and civic engagement patterns to younger generations, strengthens social bonds and mutual support networks, and enables adult children to provide care for aging parents without impossible geographic separation. These intact family networks represent crucial social infrastructure that provides economic value through informal childcare and eldercare while preserving institutional memory and community identity across generations.",
    entrepreneur: "Financial stability and accumulated home equity enable families to access capital for starting small businesses through home equity loans, cash-out refinancing, or collateralized lending at reasonable interest rates, avoiding the need for expensive venture capital or predatory high-interest loans that might otherwise prevent business formation. This access to capital enables entrepreneurship without requiring wealthy investors or well-connected networks, democratizing business ownership and creating pathways for middle-class families to build businesses that can provide employment for others while building wealth beyond what's possible through wages alone.",
    services: "Cultural amenities create substantial employment in hospitality sectors including hotels and restaurants, arts and entertainment venues, creative services including graphic design and marketing, event planning and coordination, retail specializing in local and artisanal products, and experience-based businesses that serve both residents and visitors. This service economy employment diversifies the economic base beyond manufacturing, creates accessible entry-level opportunities for young people and those without specialized technical skills, and generates tax revenues from visitor spending that subsidize amenities for residents while reducing the per-capita cost of cultural infrastructure.",
    remote: "Technology infrastructure and quality of life attract remote workers who can work from anywhere but choose to locate in the region, bringing substantial income earned from employers in expensive coastal markets into the local economy without displacing existing local jobs or workers. These remote workers increase aggregate local purchasing power and consumer spending without requiring local job creation, support premium and specialty retail that wouldn't be viable otherwise, bring diverse professional networks and experiences that enrich the community, and often become entrepreneurs who start local businesses after establishing roots in the community.",
    expansion: "Regional reputation for quality of life, strong infrastructure, available talent, and business-friendly environment attracts business expansion decisions, corporate relocations, and new market entrants who are evaluating multiple potential locations based on comprehensive assessments of costs, workforce availability, quality of life for relocating employees, and long-term growth potential. Business expansion brings not just jobs but also corporate citizenship including philanthropy, executive talent who join nonprofit boards, and connections to national networks that provide access to capital, customers, and opportunities that would be difficult for purely local businesses to access.",
    childcare: "Grandparent proximity enabled by brain drain prevention dramatically reduces childcare costs for young families, often saving $1,000-$2,000 per month per child compared to formal daycare, enabling more parents (especially mothers) to participate in the workforce without childcare costs exceeding their earnings. This informal childcare also provides children with strong relationships with extended family, transfers family values and traditions across generations, provides flexibility that formal daycare cannot match, and enables grandparents to play active roles in grandchildren's lives while young parents maintain careers rather than choosing between work and family.",
    vc: "Dense entrepreneurial ecosystem with successful startups, experienced entrepreneurs, and support services attracts venture capital firms, angel investors, and organized angel investor groups to establish local presence and actively seek investment opportunities in the region, creating viable exit opportunities for startups through acquisitions or initial public offerings. This venture capital presence provides not just funding but also mentorship, network connections, governance expertise, and validation that help startups scale successfully, while creating a virtuous cycle where successful exits create wealthy individuals who become angel investors and mentors for the next generation of entrepreneurs.",
    diversity: "Service sector growth alongside manufacturing employment diversifies the economic base and reduces dangerous dependence on single industries or employers that can devastate communities when markets shift or companies relocate, creating structural resilience where downturns in one sector can be offset by stability or growth in others. Economic diversification ensures that regional fortunes aren't tied to a single industry's boom-bust cycles, provides varied career pathways for residents with different skills and interests, and creates the kind of robust, adaptable economy that can weather national economic shocks without catastrophic local impacts.",
    social: "Third places including cafes, bookstores, community centers, parks, and gathering venues that are neither home nor work strengthen social bonds by creating spaces for informal interaction, serendipitous encounters, and community building that forge relationships across social, economic, and demographic divides. These spaces reduce crime through informal social control and collective efficacy, improve mental health outcomes by combating isolation and loneliness, increase civic participation through relationship-building that creates social trust, and generate the social capital that enables collective action to solve community problems that no individual or institution can address alone.",
    innovation: "Concentration of complementary businesses in related industries creates powerful knowledge spillover effects where geographic proximity drives innovation through informal information exchange in professional associations, chance encounters at restaurants and coffee shops, job mobility that transfers knowledge between companies, and collaborative problem-solving on shared challenges. These innovation clusters become self-reinforcing as success attracts more companies and talent, creating the kind of dynamic, innovative business environment where cutting-edge developments emerge from the intersection of diverse expertise and perspectives that only geographic proximity can enable.",
    brand: "Distinctive regional identity and positive media coverage from lifestyle publications, travel media, and social media influencers position regions as attractive destinations rather than forgettable locations, attracting tourism and visitor spending, conventions and conferences, corporate location scouts evaluating expansion opportunities, and talented individuals researching potential places to live. Regional branding creates intangible assets that differentiate communities from competitors, generate free marketing through media attention and word-of-mouth, and create pride among residents that improves civic engagement and reduces out-migration as people develop attachment to place rather than viewing their community as interchangeable with anywhere else.",
    female: "Affordable and accessible childcare enabled by grandparent proximity and formal childcare infrastructure allows more parents, especially mothers who still bear disproportionate childcare responsibilities, to participate in the workforce without childcare costs exceeding their earnings, boosting household incomes by $30,000-$50,000 annually while advancing gender equity in employment and leadership roles. Increased female workforce participation brings diverse perspectives and skills into the economy, reduces family financial stress by enabling dual-income households, increases tax revenues and consumer spending, and advances social progress by enabling women's career development and economic independence.",
    investors: "Successful startup exits through acquisitions or initial public offerings create wealthy local investors who have experienced entrepreneurial success firsthand and are committed to reinvesting in their home communities through angel investing, mentorship programs, and strategic philanthropy rather than simply moving to expensive coastal cities. These local investors understand regional opportunities and challenges better than distant venture capitalists, have personal networks that can help startups with introductions and partnerships, remain actively involved in portfolio companies rather than being absent investors, and are motivated by community building and legacy creation in addition to financial returns.",
    resilience: "Economic diversification across manufacturing, services, technology, healthcare, and other sectors creates structural resilience against industry-specific recessions where downturns in manufacturing might be offset by stability in healthcare, or service sector struggles might be balanced by manufacturing strength, stabilizing tax revenues and housing values during economic disruptions that devastate single-industry communities. This resilience prevents the catastrophic boom-bust cycles that destroy household wealth, disrupt education systems through population volatility, make long-term planning impossible, and create perpetual economic anxiety that drives talented people to seek more stable regions.",
    civic: "Transferred executives and professionals who relocate with expanding companies volunteer expertise to nonprofit organizations and join boards of community organizations, bringing sophisticated management practices, corporate connections, fundraising expertise, and strategic planning capabilities that professionalize community organizations and dramatically increase their effectiveness and access to funding. This civic expertise improves nonprofit governance, introduces best practices from other regions, connects local organizations to national networks and resources, and elevates the overall capacity of the social sector to address community challenges that government and private sector cannot solve alone.",
    knowledge: "Innovation clusters combined with university-industry partnerships and research centers position regions as recognized knowledge hubs that attract federal research grants, corporate R&D facilities, industry conferences, and talented researchers who want to be where cutting-edge developments are happening. Knowledge hub status creates permanent institutional advantages through research infrastructure, specialized facilities, and accumulated expertise that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere, establishing the region as an innovation leader whose reputation attracts additional investment, talent, and opportunities in a self-reinforcing cycle of excellence.",
    distribution: "Logistics hub status attracts national distribution centers from major retailers and manufacturers seeking strategic locations that minimize transportation costs and delivery times for serving multi-state market areas, creating permanent competitive advantages through network effects that make it economically irrational for companies to locate distribution operations elsewhere. Distribution center concentration creates thousands of logistics jobs, generates substantial property and payroll tax revenues, attracts related logistics services and suppliers, and establishes regions as indispensable nodes in national supply chains whose importance grows rather than diminishes over time as network effects strengthen.",
    capital: "Household savings accumulated through income stability and improved health outcomes create local capital pools in community banks, credit unions, and regional financial institutions that enable small business lending, mortgage origination, and community investment to remain in the community rather than being extracted by national financial institutions that allocate capital to higher-return markets in major metropolitan areas. Retained local capital enables community control over investment priorities, funds businesses and projects that might not meet national lending criteria but serve important community needs, builds community wealth that stays local across generations, and creates economic sovereignty where communities control their own economic destinies rather than being dependent on external capital providers.",
    medical: "Healthcare centers providing advanced services attract medical research operations, clinical trials, pharmaceutical company partnerships, and academic medical center affiliations that establish regions as healthcare destinations attracting medical tourism from surrounding areas, creating specialized employment in biomedical research, and positioning the region for growth in one of the few sectors with consistent long-term job growth. Medical research creates high-paying jobs requiring advanced degrees, generates intellectual property and licensing revenues, attracts federal research funding, and positions regions at the intersection of healthcare and advanced manufacturing as medical device and pharmaceutical production seeks proximity to research operations.",
    edu_cycle: "Higher household incomes from dual-earner families and increased female workforce participation enable substantial parental investment in childhood education, enrichment activities including music lessons and sports, tutoring and academic support, summer programs and camps, and educational travel that creates intergenerational cycles of educational achievement where each generation attains higher educational levels than the previous generation. These achievement cycles compound community human capital advantages over time as increasingly educated populations attract industries requiring highly skilled workers, support more sophisticated cultural amenities and civic institutions, and generate innovations that create new economic opportunities unavailable to less educated regions.",
    social_svc: "Philanthropic capital from successful entrepreneurs and angel investors funds nonprofit organizations addressing social challenges including food insecurity, addiction treatment and recovery services, mental health support, youth development programs, and affordable housing, improving community social indicators that further attract families and businesses who evaluate communities based on social factors beyond simple economics. Well-funded social services prevent social problems from becoming crises, support vulnerable populations, reduce crime and its associated costs, improve health outcomes, and create the kind of comprehensive social safety net that enables people to take risks like entrepreneurship or job changes without fear of destitution if things don't work out.",
    blight: "Stable housing values maintained through economic resilience prevent foreclosure cascades during recessions where falling home values trigger strategic defaults that further depress prices in a downward spiral, maintaining neighborhood cohesion and social networks, preserving property maintenance and upkeep, and preventing the decades-long urban blight cycles that can take generations to reverse once they begin. Preventing blight preserves household wealth, maintains tax revenues for public services, prevents displacement of long-term residents, protects neighborhood schools from destabilization, and avoids the enormous public costs of dealing with abandoned properties, crime increases, and infrastructure deterioration that follow once neighborhoods begin declining.",
    democracy: "Strong social capital developed through community gathering spaces and civic engagement increases civic participation in city council meetings, school board sessions, planning commissions, and neighborhood associations while improving democratic discourse quality through relationships that create trust and shared commitment to community welfare across political and demographic divides. This democratic vitality creates accountability pressure on elected officials to govern effectively, improves policy quality through informed public input, enables evidence-based decision-making rather than purely ideological positions, and generates the kind of effective local governance that makes communities attractive to businesses and families who value well-run institutions and rational public policy.",
    institutional: "Universities, research centers, specialized research facilities, and centers of excellence represent massive infrastructure investments requiring hundreds of millions of dollars and decades to establish, creating permanent competitive advantages that cannot be easily replicated by competitor regions who would need to make similar long-term investments with uncertain returns. These institutional advantages become more valuable over time as accumulated research, specialized equipment, expert faculty, and industry partnerships create knowledge ecosystems th
